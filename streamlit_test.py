st.subheader('Fantasy is an online game in which players collect points based on how real life footballers perform each week.You need to fill your team with all the positions and you are not allowed to simply buy 11 strikers who score goals every weekend. You need goalkeepers, defenders and midfielders too, plus one substitute for each position. 3 players are the maximum from one club.')

st.header('How do the points work ?')

st.subheader('Each position on the pitch comes with its own points system. The goalkeepers and defenders are most commonly rewarded for things such as saving a penalty (5 points) or keeping a clean sheet (4 points); midfielders for setting up a goal (3); and strikers for scoring (4).')
st.subheader('It is also worth noting that players can lose points for negative actions in real-life, such as getting sent off (-3 points) or missing a penalty (-2).')
